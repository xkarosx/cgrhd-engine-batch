# cgrhd-engine-batch
Cpu Gpu Ram Hard Drive or CGRHD is for emulating cpu,gpu,ram and hard drive, and it is used for batch programs as a batch engine.

## how it works
CGRHD will emulate an eviroments for the batch program and basicliy will calculate the requests it recieves as if it is an graphical sence in which the program wants
to display or stoaring some data in ram or stoaring a long time data in hard drive which can be accsesd by the program at any given time.
***for those who say that this is pointless: i mean seriously would you code your program to load a graphical sence and make the work harder for yourself, or just use this engine and the engine will do it for you. the engine does so much more than the graphical emulation so be sure to give it a chance!***
